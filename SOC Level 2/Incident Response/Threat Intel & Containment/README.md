# TryHackMe Room: Threat Intel & Containment

This room bridges the gap between detecting a security incident and stopping it. I explored different Containment Strategies (balancing risk vs. intelligence gathering) and learned how to extract artifacts from an attack to generate Threat Intelligence, creating a feedback loop that strengthens future defenses.

## Section: Pre-Containment

### Task 1: What does the acronym IDS mean?

As stated in the room's introduction, collecting evidence often involves gathering data from network infrastructure components such as an Intrusion Detection System.

## Section: Containment Strategies

### Task 1: What is the name of the containment strategy used when the responders closely monitor the adversary?

There is a strategy where, instead of immediately cutting off access, the incident response team keeps the system accessible. This allows them to watch the adversary's moves and gather intelligence without tipping them off.

Answer: Controlled Isolation

### Task 2: What containment strategy is considered to be the most aggressive?

Conversely, the strategy involving immediate and total disconnection of the infected device (via network segmentation or physical unplugging) is known as the most aggressive approach.

Answer: Entire isolation

## Section: Creating Threat Intelligence

### Task 1: What is the term for a set of characters that can be used to give an attribution to a file?

A unique string of characters generated by a cryptographic algorithm that identifies a specific file (often used to verify integrity or identify malware) is called a Hash.

## Section: Threat Intelligence Creation Feedback Loop

### Task 1: What is the name of the classic arcade game that has been referenced in this task?

The text uses a metaphor to describe the inefficient cycle of responding to incidents without applying threat intelligence to prevent them permanently.

Answer: Whack-a-mole

## Section: Practical

### Task 1: What is the IP address of the adversary?

I launched Wireshark and opened the pcapng file located on the Desktop. Since the scenario involved a file download, I filtered the traffic for HTTP requests to make the analysis easier.

http

Looking at the traffic, I could see a request to download a file. The Source IP address sending the file was the adversary.

### Task 2: What is the name of the file that gets downloaded from the adversary's infrastructure?

In the same Wireshark view (Screenshot 01), looking at the Info column or the HTTP stream details revealed the name of the file being transferred.

### Task 3: What is the SHA-256 hash value of the value of the executable on the Desktop?

To identify the specific malware variant, I opened the terminal and used the sha256sum utility on the target executable found on the Desktop.

sha256sum <filename>

# Summary

In this room, I learned to:

- Differentiate Containment Strategies: Understanding when to use Controlled Isolation (for intel) versus Entire Isolation (for immediate safety).
- Extract IOCs: Using Wireshark to pull network-based indicators like IP addresses and filenames.
- Generate Intel: Using file hashing tools to create host-based indicators that feed back into the defense cycle.
